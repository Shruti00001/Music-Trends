## ðŸŽ¶ Music Trends Dashboard: Streaming Insights & Genre Evolution

### ðŸ’¡ The Business Problem  
Music platforms generate massive amounts of listener data, but artists and marketers often struggle to extract meaningful insights. This project tackles that gap by analyzing genre popularity, platform usage, and tempo trends to uncover what drives listener engagement.

---

### ðŸš€ The Solution  
This end-to-end analytics project transforms raw music data into a visually compelling Power BI dashboard. It combines Python-driven preprocessing with interactive visuals to reveal how music consumption is evolving across platforms and time.

---

### ðŸ“Š Key Insights at a Glance  
- **Genre Popularity**: Pop and EDM dominate streaming platforms, but niche genres like Lo-fi and Indie are gaining traction among younger audiences.
- **Platform Trends**: Spotify leads in diversity of genres, while YouTube shows higher engagement for regional and remix content.
- **Tempo Evolution**: Tracks with mid-tempo (90â€“110 BPM) show higher average popularity, suggesting a shift toward chill, groove-based listening.

### ðŸ“ˆ Project Impact  
This dashboard goes beyond surface-level statsâ€”it tells a story about how music tastes are changing and where opportunities lie for artists, marketers, and platforms. It showcases my ability to:

- Clean & transform complex datasets using Python  
- Design layered visuals that reveal trends across genre, tempo, and platform  
- Communicate insights with clarity and visual storytelling
