# Music-Trends
üß† Overview
Analyzed a dataset of 140 Spotify tracks to uncover insights into how music preferences evolved over time. This project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

üîç Objectives
- Identify track distribution across decades
- Highlight genre trends and artist frequency
- Create compelling visuals for trend analysis
  
üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for project documentation and sharing
  
üìä Key Visuals
- Decade-wise track distribution bar chart
- Genre comparison plots
- Heatmaps showing correlation between popularity, duration, and year
  
üí° Insights
- Most tracks clustered in the 2010s, with genre diversity peaking during that period
- Pop and Indie were dominant genres, while others showed niche growth
- Duration and popularity showed moderate correlation, especially in earlier decades
  
üöÄ What I Learned
- Tackled datatype issues using pd.to_numeric()
- Enhanced plotting techniques with customized palettes and axis formatting
- Strengthened my GitHub workflow by uploading code, visuals, and documentation

üìå Next Steps
- Expand analysis to include lyrical sentiment
- Deploy as an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Tableau
- Integrate with Spotify‚Äôs API for real-time data tracking
