## ðŸŽ¶ Music Trends Dashboard: Streaming Insights & Genre Evolution

### ðŸ’¡ The Business Problem  
Music platforms generate massive amounts of listener data, but artists and marketers often struggle to extract meaningful insights. This project tackles that gap by analyzing genre popularity, platform usage, and tempo trends to uncover what drives listener engagement.
